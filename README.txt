Project Description:
In this recent project, I created a JavaFX application that simulates Wordle. I built this using Java 11 and JavaFX for the GUI components and used Maven for project management. I also used an MVC design to separate the logic from the UI to keep it readable and scalable. Some features I implemented were real-time word validation, score tracking, and serialization/deserialization of saved game data. The word validation feature checks if the word is in the 10,000+ list of guessable words and if the word is the correct length. The program also selects a random word from a list of over 2,000 potential words. To implement a load/save feature, I serialized the game state to a file and deserialized it when the app was reopened. This project also taught me front-end design and how to create a user-friendly interface.
